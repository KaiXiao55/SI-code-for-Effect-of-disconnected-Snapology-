# 1: Code for linearizing the constraints of spatial closed loop structure
Tested in Mathematica 12
# 2: Code of calculating stiffness
The code of calculating stiffness is writtern by Kai Xiao, tested in MATLAB 2020a. Before runnning the main code, decompress the case file (e.g. state#1a.1) from example. zip file to the same path of MATLAB code
