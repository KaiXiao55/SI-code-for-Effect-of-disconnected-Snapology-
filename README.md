# 1: Code of linearizing the constraints of spatial closed loop structure
Tested in Mathematica 12
# 2: Code of calculating stiffness
The code of calculating stiffness is writtern by Kai Xiao, tested in MATLAB 2020a. Before runnning the main code, decompress the case file (e.g. state#1a.1) from example. zip file to the same path of MATLAB code 
# 3: Code of numerically calculating DOF of defect structures.
- The method is from  Laliberte, T. & Gosselin, C. Construction, mobility analysis and synthesis of polyhedra with articulated faces. J. Mechanisms Robotics 6, 011007 (2013).
